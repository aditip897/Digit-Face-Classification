Built using Python

Uses Naive Bayes and Perceptron algorithms to classify faces and images given dataset

I implemented the Perceptron and Naive Bayes algorithms on digit and face datasets, training them on the respective training datasets using 10% to 100% of the data points

Three components are implemented for digit and face classification algorithms: Naive Bayes, Perceptron, and Feature Extraction
